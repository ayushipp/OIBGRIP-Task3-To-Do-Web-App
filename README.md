# OIBGRIP-Task3-To-Do-Web-App
Developed a basic to-do web app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

The to-do web app allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list is visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.

Also added a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user is able to delete or edit tasks from it.
